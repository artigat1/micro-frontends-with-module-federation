### Running

Yarn has been used, so run yarn to install all the packages and then `yarn start` to run the solution.

The application runs on http://localhost:3000/

When running, the code will automatically recompile any changes, although the hot module reload doesn't seem to work, so need to hit refresh on the browser to see any changes.
